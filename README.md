# Instrutables IC Tester


> As in 2021 Instrutable is conducting a contest on PCB designing.This is a custom made IC tester pcb which can test logic gate IC of 74XX series.I love to call it "IC Doctor" When you are working on DIY project and don't have time to test each IC, this device comes into play which can test IC's within seconds and main feature it can easily fit into your pocket and can be carried almost anywhere...

# PCB Description
>The following design is made under the idea of creating a handy Logic IC Tester board which will suit a purpose to test logic gates quickly.I love to call it "IC Doctor" When you are working on DIY project and don't have time to test each IC, this device comes into play which can test IC's within seconds and main feature it can easily fit into your pocket and can be carried almost anywhere...
